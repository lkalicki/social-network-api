# Social Network API

## Description 

The Social Network API is designed to be a social network web application that leverages Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM to help store and use data. It allows users to share their thoughts, reach to their friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. 

## Installation

In order to install the Social Network API, the user must download the code and then initialize the directory to run Node.js, as well as ensure MongoDB is downloaded on their system, and the Express.js and Mongoose packages have been installed via npm install. Additionally, Insomnia is needed in order to test the API routes. 

## Usage 

A Walkthrough video of the Social Network API routes being tested via Insomnia is available [here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/f91f5YCadhwJjPteR8mW).

Future areas of opportunity include adding HTML pages so a front end can be connected to the backend for a fully functioning application.
